Fig. 2: Elliptic umbilic singularity set. Surface of EP locations as a function of physical parameters (singularity set) explained in Fig. 1. In the weakly nonlinear regime, α ≪ γ, the shape
approaches that of an elliptic umbilic bifurcation (‘catastrophe’). The shape of each singularity set consists of two infinite three–cusped conical surfaces, the apices of which meet at the two linear EPs
(α, β, δ) = (0, ±γ, 0). At large α, the three–cusped shape remains but is deformed guaranteeing that the two cone-like surfaces originating at β = ±1 do not overlap.

Fig. 3: Cross section of singularity set. Cross section of EP surface for fixed nonlinearity α; axis are rescaled. Here, β′ = β − γ. 
Small α ≪ γ: deltoid or three-cusped hypocycloid of the elliptic umbilic surface with exact scaling. 
Large α: exact scaling is lost, but three–cusped shape remains. The half-infinite line where PT symmetry is unbroken is indicated by the blue line.

Fig. 4: Selected complex eigenvalue traces. Complex eigenvalues (real and imaginary parts) of H in Eq (1) at fixed, nonzero α/γ = 1 across lines in the (β′, δ) plane shown as insets. 
Regardless of the lines’ directions, we have two and four eigenvalues outside and inside the cone, respectively, in agreement with the number of values of critical points of the Lyapunov potential (see Supplementary Figure 3 for examples of the potential landscape). 
At the smooth parts of the deltoid boundary (fold lines), two states are created/annihilated, and two states are unaffected by the boundary (a,b,e,f). Crossing the cusp, (c,d), three states coalesce at a 3rd-order nonlinear EP, denoted as EP3, and one state is unaffected.
