# Universal-topology-of-exceptional-points-in-nonlinear-non-Hermitian-systems

This repository contains MATLAB code to reproduce the main figures from our paper:

> **Title:** Universal topology of exceptional points in nonlinear non-Hermitian systems
> 
> **Authors:** Nai Kwong, Jan Wingenbach, Laura Ares, Jan Sperling, Xuekai Ma, Stefan Schumacher, Rolf Binder
> 
> **Abstract:**  
> Exceptional points (EPs) are non-Hermitian degeneracies where eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce, 
> giving rise to unusual physical effects across scientific disciplines. The concept of EPs has recently been extended to nonlinear physical systems.
> We theoretically demonstrate a universal topology, defined here as the topology of a universal unfolding,
> in the nonlinear parameter space for a large class of physical systems that support $2^\mathrm{nd}$ order  EPs in the linear regime. Knowledge of this topology (called elliptic umbilic singularity in bifurcation theory) deepens our understanding of $2^\mathrm{nd}$ order linear EPs,
> which here emerge as coalescence of 4 nonlinear eigenvectors. This helps guide future experimental discovery of nonlinear EPs and their classification, 
> establish rigorous bounds of sensitivity enhancement of EPs in nonlinear systems, and helps envision and optimize technological applications of nonlinear EPs. 
> Our theoretical approach is general and can be extended to nonlinear perturbations of $3^\mathrm{rd}$ and higher-order EPs.

Fig. 2: Elliptic umbilic singularity set. Surface of EP locations as a function of physical parameters (singularity set) explained in Fig. 1. In the weakly nonlinear regime, Œ± ‚â™ Œ≥, the shape
approaches that of an elliptic umbilic bifurcation (‚Äòcatastrophe‚Äô). The shape of each singularity set consists of two infinite three‚Äìcusped conical surfaces, the apices of which meet at the two linear EPs
(Œ±, Œ≤, Œ¥) = (0, ¬±Œ≥, 0). At large Œ±, the three‚Äìcusped shape remains but is deformed guaranteeing that the two cone-like surfaces originating at Œ≤ = ¬±1 do not overlap.

Fig. 3: Cross section of singularity set. Cross section of EP surface for fixed nonlinearity Œ±; axis are rescaled. Here, Œ≤‚Ä≤ = Œ≤ ‚àí Œ≥. 
Small Œ± ‚â™ Œ≥: deltoid or three-cusped hypocycloid of the elliptic umbilic surface with exact scaling. 
Large Œ±: exact scaling is lost, but three‚Äìcusped shape remains. The half-infinite line where PT symmetry is unbroken is indicated by the blue line.

Fig. 4: Selected complex eigenvalue traces. Complex eigenvalues (real and imaginary parts) of H in Eq (1) at fixed, nonzero Œ±/Œ≥ = 1 across lines in the (Œ≤‚Ä≤, Œ¥) plane shown as insets. 
Regardless of the lines‚Äô directions, we have two and four eigenvalues outside and inside the cone, respectively, in agreement with the number of values of critical points of the Lyapunov potential (see Supplementary Figure 3 for examples of the potential landscape). 
At the smooth parts of the deltoid boundary (fold lines), two states are created/annihilated, and two states are unaffected by the boundary (a,b,e,f). Crossing the cusp, (c,d), three states coalesce at a 3rd-order nonlinear EP, denoted as EP3, and one state is unaffected
