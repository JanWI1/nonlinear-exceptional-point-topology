# Universal-topology-of-exceptional-points-in-nonlinear-non-Hermitian-systems
MATLAB code and data to reproduce the figures in the paper “Universal topology of nonlinear exceptional points”, demonstrating a universal topology, in the nonlinear parameter space for a large class of physical systems that support 2nd order EPs  in the linear regime.
