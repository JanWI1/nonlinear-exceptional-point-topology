This repository contains MATLAB code to reproduce the main figures from our paper:

> **Title:** Universal topology of exceptional points in nonlinear non-Hermitian systems
> 
> **Authors:** Nai Kwong, Jan Wingenbach, Laura Ares, Jan Sperling, Xuekai Ma, Stefan Schumacher, Rolf Binder
> 
> **Abstract:**  
> Exceptional points (EPs) are non-Hermitian degeneracies where eigenvalues and eigenvectors coalesce, 
> giving rise to unusual physical effects across scientific disciplines. The concept of EPs has recently been extended to nonlinear physical systems.
> We theoretically demonstrate a universal topology, defined here as the topology of a universal unfolding,
> in the nonlinear parameter space for a large class of physical systems that support $2^\mathrm{nd}$ order  EPs in the linear regime. Knowledge of this topology (called elliptic umbilic singularity in bifurcation theory) deepens our understanding of $2^\mathrm{nd}$ order linear EPs,
> which here emerge as coalescence of 4 nonlinear eigenvectors. This helps guide future experimental discovery of nonlinear EPs and their classification, 
> establish rigorous bounds of sensitivity enhancement of EPs in nonlinear systems, and helps envision and optimize technological applications of nonlinear EPs. 
> Our theoretical approach is general and can be extended to nonlinear perturbations of $3^\mathrm{rd}$ and higher-order EPs.
